                "teacher": "That's a good start! Remember, the park gives children below 12 years a $5 discount. If the regular ticket price is $109, what would be the price of each child's ticket after applying the discount?",
                "student": "Oh I see, so I have to subtract $5 from the regular price of $109. That makes each child's ticket cost $104."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You've got it! Now, if each child's ticket is $104, can you tell me how much would the two children's tickets cost in total?",
                "student": "Sure, if each child's ticket is $104, then two children's tickets would cost $208 in total."

            {
                "teacher": "That's correct! Now that we know how much the children's tickets cost, we have to consider the parents' tickets too. How much will the couple need to pay for their tickets without any discount?\n",
                "student": "The parents don't get the discount, so their tickets are $109 each. That means they need to pay $218 for both of their tickets."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "That's right! So, we know the cost of the children's tickets and the parents' tickets separately. Can we now find out how much the entire family needs to pay to enter the amusement park?",
                "student": "Yes, I need to add up the cost of the children's tickets and the cost of the parents' tickets. So, $208 plus $218 gives a total of $426 for the whole family's entrance."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "Exactly! Now, we know the family gave the cashier $500 and the total cost for tickets is $426, can you work out how much change the family will receive after buying the tickets?",
                "student": "Yes, to get the change, I need to subtract the total cost of the tickets from the amount they gave to the cashier. So, $500 minus $426 equals $74. The family will receive $74 in change."
            },
            {

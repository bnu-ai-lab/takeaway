                "teacher": "That's a excellent question! When we make calculations about the area of a wall, should we add the width and height, or should we multiply them?",
                "student": "I guess we add them because we're adding the length and width of the wall together. So the area of each wall is 5 meters for the first ones, 7 meters for the next one and 6 meters for the last wall."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "You're on the right path but there's a little mistake. When we want to find the area of a rectangle we multiply the length and the width, not add them. If we use this rule, can you try again and calculate the area of each wall in square meters?",
                "student": "So, we multiply, not add? Okay, I think I get it. So, the first two walls have an area of 6 square meters each, the third one has an area of 10 square meters and the last one is 8 square meters. Is that right?"
            },
            {
                "teacher": "That's correct! You did a great job calculating the area of each wall. The first two walls are indeed 6 square meters each, the third one is 10 square meters, and the last one is 8 square meters. Now, adding these, can you tell me how many total square meters Lucille needs to paint?",
                "student": "Absolutely! We just add the total square meters together. That's 6 plus 6 plus 10 plus 8, that equals to 30 square meters."

            {
                "teacher": "You're absolutely right! Lucille's total wall area is indeed 30 square meters. Now, if each can of paint covers 2 square meters, how many cans of paint do you think Lucille will need to cover all her walls?",
                "student": "If one can covers 2 square meters, then to cover 30 square meters, we will need 15 cans of paint."

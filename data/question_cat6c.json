                "teacher": "Well, let's see. You've stated that 7 leaves fell in the first hour, and 4 leaves fell in each of the second and third hours. Can you add these up to see how many leaves fell in total over the three hours?",
                "student": "Oh! Sorry for the mistake in calculation. It's 7 for the first hour, then 4 and 4 for the next two hours. So, the total would be 15 leaves."

            {
                "teacher": "That's correct! Now that we know the total number of leaves that fell over the three hours, can we figure out the average number of leaves that fell per hour? What do you think?",
                "student": "I think it's 15 divided by the 3 hours, so the average would be 5 leaves per hour."
            },
            {
                "teacher": "Absolutely! When we know the total number of leaves that fell and the number of hours, we can find the average number of leaves per hour by dividing the total number of leaves by the number of hours. So, 15 leaves divided by 3 hours equals 5 leaves per hour. You've got it!"
